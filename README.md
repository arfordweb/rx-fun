Inspired by [Fran√ßois Bonnefont](https://github.com/happypoulp)'s
[Redux Tutorial](https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial), I decided to create something
similar to help me (and hopefully others) learn RxJS Observables.

Setup
-----
Run `npm install` or `yarn install` at the root of this repo.

View the `src/` files in your edit to view each lesson.  The output will be contained
within each file.  But you can run the example code yourself with, for example,
`node src/00_why_observables.js`
